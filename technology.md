# Technology

## Slack

You can use the following [Slack invite](https://join.slack.com/t/umphysics/shared_invite/zt-2orlcba0h-epAdT7yUFDU4eSgpN2XR_A) to join the UM Physics workspace.
Once you have joined the workspace send me a private message and I'll add you to our private channel. I'll post notifications of any announcements on that channel. 
I encourage you all to use it for collaborating and discussing material, as well as communicating with me.

## Zoom

We may need Zoom for possibly remote classes since I will be out of town during the semester periodically. I'll update the site accordingly as needed. But it is still a good idea to get yourself a Zoom account via this [OleMiss Zoom](https://olemiss.zoom/us) link.

## GitHub

A GitHub account is required for this course to access additional course material hosted in our [PHYS709-Fall2024 GitHub repository](https://github.com/olemiss-physics/PHYS709-Fall2024).
If you have an account already ignore this step, otherwise go ahead and create and account by going to the [GitHub Sign up](https://github.com/signup) link and filing in the registration form.
Or simply follow the [Creating an account on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github) documentation. For the record, other services do exist but this is one I frequently use for research.

> Once you have created your account, you can secure a FREE GitHub Pro, with additional benefits, by [joining GitHub Education](https://github.com/edu/students), taking advantage of your olemiss.edu email.

Once you have a GitHub account, send me your GitHub username so that I can add you to the repository. You're now ready to proceed to the [Version Control]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link calendar.md %}) tutorial.

## Python and Jupyter

Details coming soon...
