I've posted [Homework #4]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link hw/phys709-hmwk-4.pdf %}). It is due by Monday, October 21st, in class.
Please attach the homework cover sheet to your work. Start new problems on a new page, clearly indicating what problem you are working; ideally, arrange them in the order they are presented on the cover sheet. Make sure all work is clear, and legible.

I've also posted [Computing Task 3 (CT3)]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link tutorials/python.md %}) and it is due by Friday, October 18th.

Start working on these in class today (October 9th).
