I will post the next homework set this week, but first don't forget we have Midterm Exam from 12:45 - 2:15 pm.
It will cover everything through Oscillations.

I've posted [Computing Task 4 (CT4)]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link tutorials/kepler.md %}) and it is due by Friday, November 8th.
This was announced in-class so this just serves as a reminder.
