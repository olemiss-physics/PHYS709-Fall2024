I've posted [Homework #3]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link hw/phys709-hmwk-3.pdf %}). It is due by Wednesday, October 2nd, in class.
Please attach the homework cover sheet to your work. Start new problems on a new page, clearly indicating what problem you are working; ideally, arrange them in the order they are presented on the cover sheet. Make sure all work is clear, and legible.

I remind folks that we have an [Attendance Policy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link syllabus/policies.md %}#attendance) and also to please arrive to class on time.

Do not forget that [Computing Task 2 (CT2)]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link tutorials/git2.md %}) is due by Wednesday, September 25th.

Recall that we will not have an official class on Friday since I am traveling. I encourage you to use the time to work together on the homework and/or catch up on the reading.
