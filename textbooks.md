# Textbooks

By no means an exhaustive list, these are all texts that I have consulted and find good explanations for different concepts. It is especially important to gather different perspectives and descriptions of concepts from many sources.
The **Required** textbook covers the essential material, but I will not necessarily follow just this text. I will point out reading assignments on the course [Calendar page]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link calendar.md %}).

## Required

**Classical Mechanics**, H. Goldstein, C. Poole & J. Safko (Third Edition, 2002)
- Many consider the standard in advanced classical mechanics.
- There is also an [Errate page](http://astro.physics.sc.edu/goldstein) that is worth consulting. I will try to identify any errors when selecting homework sets but take this into consideration.

## Suggested

**Theoretical Mechanics of Particles and Continua**, A.L. Fetter and J.D. Walecka
- this is a good textbook although a bit dense at times. I taught this class using this textbook for a couple of years (inherited syllabus) and have slowly switched to Goldstein et al. I will use problems from this book and suggest readings from time to time.

**Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems**, S.T. Thornton and J.B. Marion (Fifth Edition)
- Often used for advanced undergraduate. 

**Classical Mechanics**, J.R. Taylor
- an excellent intermediate-level textbook, generally used for upper-level undergraduate. Taylor also won an Emmy Award for his television series _Physics 4 fun_.

## Additional

**Lectures on Classical Dynamics**, D. Tong
- These are [online-only](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/dynamics.html)
- This set of classical mechanics notes are great (check out all the other topical notes therein too), but they are organized in a different fashion to this course.

**Mechanics**, L. Landau & E. Lifshitz

**Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics**, V.I. Arnold
