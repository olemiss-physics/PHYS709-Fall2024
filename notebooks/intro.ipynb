    "A Jupyter notebook is displayed on a web browser on a computer, tablet (e.g., iPad), or even your smartphone.  The notebook is divided into *cells*, of which the two most popular types are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Markdown cells: These have headings, text, and mathematical formulas in $\\LaTeX$ using a simple form of HTML called [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/).\n",
    "* Code cells: These have Python code (or other languages, but we'll stick to Python).\n",
    "\n",
    "Either type of cell can be selected with your cursor and will be highlighted in color when active.  You **evaluate** an active cell by pressing `shift+enter` (as in *Mathematica*) or by hitting the play button on the toolbar, or selecting `Run->Run Selected Cell` from the menu.  Some notes:\n",
    "* When a new cell is inserted, it is a Code cell by default and will have `In []:` in front.  You can type Python expressions or entire programs in a cell!  How you break up code between cells is your choice; you can always put Markdown cells in between too. When you evaluate a cell it will be marked with a consecutive number, e.g., `In [5]:`.\n",
    "* The toolbar contains a pulldown menu that lets you change back and forth between Code and Markdown cells.  Once you evaluate a Markdown cell, it will be rendered (formatted), and marked with a blue border when selected.  To edit the Markdown cell, double-click on it.\n",
    "* Make heavy use of Markdown cells to document your code. **Document, document, document!**\n",
    "* Look at the formatting of each cell to quickly see examples of how to use the Markdown language to format this document.   \n",
    "\n",
    "**Try double-clicking on this cell and then `shift+enter`.**  You will see that a bullet list is created just with an asterisk and a space at the beginning of lines (without the space, or with one asterisk, text will be formatted in *italics* and with two asterisks text will be **bold**).  **Double click on the title header above and you'll see it starts with a single #.**  Headings of subsections are made using ## or ###.  See this [Markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for a quick tour of the Markdown language (including how to add hyperlinks!). Alternatively, you can read the [Markdown Guide Cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). Markdown is a very powerful, future-proof format. For interest, I mention [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a personal knowledge, note-taking app built on Markdown files. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Now try turning the next (empty) cell to a Markdown cell and type:** `Einstein says $E=mc^2$` **and then evaluate it.**  This is $\\LaTeX$! (If you forget to convert to Markdown and get `SyntaxError: invalid syntax`, just select the cell and convert to Markdown with the menu.)"
