# Assessment

The final grade and score will be tentatively determined from the following criteria:

- Homework (40%)

Typically several problem	sets will be assigned out of each chapter. Some of the problems are rather difficult and involved, so it is best to start the problems early so you have time to work them out and/or seek help. Physics is very rarely done alone. I encourage you to form study groups in preparation for homework assignments and tests. However, the homework assignments should be the work of the individual student. If you can not do the homework, you will not do well on the tests!

- Computational Projects (10%)

There will be a handful of computational assignments throughout the semester that should also aid your understanding of classical mechanics concepts. 

- Midterm Test (25%)

There will be one midterm test, consisting of short answer style and problems to be worked out. Students are permitted a calculator, but I doubt you will use it. To allow more flexibility on time, midterm tests _may_ be given outside of the normal meeting time.

- Final Exam (25%)

A cumulative final exam will be given on **Friday, December 13 from 8 am - 11 am**. Details on the topics stressed and exam policies will be given later in the semester.


Any changes in the scoring scheme will be communicated via the Announcements page and Slack channel.
