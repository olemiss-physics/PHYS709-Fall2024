# Policies

## Attendance

Students are expected to attend each lecture unless you have justification. If you must miss a lecture, **make contact with me as soon as possible**. Absences from tests count as zeros unless they are justified. If you must be absent during a test for a University-sponsored event, you MUST discuss this with me before the test date. In the case of an unexpected emergency, you must make contact with me as soon as possible and have documentation.


## Academic Integrity

Every student of the University of Mississippi, by virtue of choosing to be part of the university community agrees to abide by the University of Mississippi Creed and the UM Academic Integrity Policy that covers academic integrity. Please consult the M-Book, Academic Integrity document for details on university policy and the academic creed.

**Cheating is forbidden and will result in a zero grade on the assignment. If a second case of cheating occurs, this will result in an F for the entire course.**

## UM Creed

- I believe in respect for the dignity of each person
