## Description

This is a standard core course in the graduate curriculum for Physics. In this course, we will learn advanced methods of analyzing the mechanical properties and dynamics of particles, systems of particles, and extended bodies in translational, bounded (periodic), and rotational motion. We will also
learn Hamiltonâ€™s methods in classical mechanics which provide a fluid transition to concepts in quantum mechanics.

## Objectives

The significant goals of this course are for students to advance and expand their mathematical toolkit and improve their analytical reasoning. Part of this consists of "applying equations" and "getting the right result", but students will be evaluated on a broader set of skills, including the way they analyze a problem and place it in context, as well as how they write about it. 


## Format

The course will be taught in a mixed lecture and flipped-classroom format. To take full advantage of the lectures, you should **read the relevant sections of the book BOTH before and after the lecture**. During class meetings, we will discuss open issues from the readings, some lecture-time and additional time set asside during the week to work through exercises and homework in small groups. These problems are intended to help you understand the material and to prepare you for the exams. I will seek feedback during the semester on how this approach is (or is not) working for folks. I reserve the right to adjust during the semester. I will be introducing some computational projects during this course.
Classes will be held in person, but there may be times throughout the semester that I have to travel, in which case I leave the option open for a virtual class via Zoom.

## Technology

The course will employ the following required technology:

- [Slack](): a private channel within the UM Physics workspace to encourage collaborative work and discussions. You can also reach out to me via this medium (it is preferred over email).
- [GitHub](https://github.com/join): a GitHub account is required for this course to access additional course material hosted in our [PHYS709-Fall2024 GitHub repository](https://github.com/olemiss-physics/PHYS709-Fall2024). For more details, see the dedicated [Technology]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link technology.md %}) page.
- [Zoom](https://olemiss.zoom/us): for possible remote class meetings and office hours; only in the situation that I am out of town. In person attendance is required.
