# PHYS 709 Advanced Mechanics I

Fall 2024 University of Mississippi Department of Physics & Astronomy graduate course.

This is a standard core course in the University of Mississippi graduate curriculum for Physics. In this course, we will learn advanced methods of analyzing the mechanical properties and dynamics of particles, systems of particles, and extended bodies in translational, bounded (periodic), and rotational motion. We will also learn Hamilton's methods in classical mechanics which provide a fluid transition to concepts in quantum mechanics.


## Site Inspiration

This website boilerplate was generated following [Just the Class](https://kevinl.info/just-the-class/): a GitHub Pages template developed for the purpose of quickly deploying course websites. 
Just the Class is a template that extends the popular [Just the Docs](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs) theme.

## Getting Started

Getting started with Just the Class is simple.

1. Create a [new repository based on Just the Class](https://github.com/kevinlin1/just-the-class/generate).
1. Update `_config.yml` and `README.md` with your course information. [Be sure to update the url and baseurl](https://mademistakes.com/mastering-jekyll/site-url-baseurl/).
1. Configure a [publishing source for GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages). Your course website is now live!
1. Edit and create `.md` [Markdown files](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to add more content pages.

### Local development environment

Just the Class requires no special Jekyll plugins and can run on GitHub Pages' standard Jekyll compiler. To setup a local development environment, clone your template repository and follow the GitHub Docs on [Testing your GitHub Pages site locally with Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll).

1. Install Jekyll
1. Install Ruby
1. Clone this repo:
`git clone git@github.com:olemiss-physics/PHYS709-Fall2024.git`

In the repository directory, run:
```
gem install bundler
bundle install
```
Serve the project locally:
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
This will start the local Jekyll server at http://localhost:4000/PHYS709-Fall2024.
You can make local modifications and they should reflect on this open local webpage.
