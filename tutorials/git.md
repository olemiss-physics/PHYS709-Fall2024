# Version Control

This tutorial describes the basic usage of git, a version control system to track code changes among yourself and any collaborators.
If you run into any difficulties following any of these steps, please post in our class channel (#phys709-fall2024) on Slack.

## Create your own repository

We created our account in prior steps so now we're ready to actually utilize version control.
Git is a version control system that lets you share versions of code remotely with other collaborators (or have a remote version you can save and access from any computer).
GitHub is a cloud-based platform that uses Git for storing, managing, and sharing code.

Once logged in you can create a new repository (or git-enabled folder) by clicking the bright green "New" button (you may need to navigate to "Repositories" first).
Go ahead and create a new repo called `test-repo`; you can choose Public or Private depending on who you want to grant viewership.
Click to add a README, then click "Create repository".

You'll now be on the landing page for your newly created repository.
