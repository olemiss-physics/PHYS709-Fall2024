# Python and Jupyter II

You have successfully installed Jupyter with your own virtual environment using Python tools. If that's not the case, follow the [Python and Jupyter]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link tutorials/python.md %}) installation page instructions.

Otherwise, you are now ready to start using your Jupyter installation to view/edit/create notebooks.

{: .note }
> Don't forget to activate your virtual environment to use Jupyter.
> It only exists in your virtual environment.
```zsh
source ~/venvs/.my-venv/bin/activate
```

## Using Jupyter

Since we are now able to open Jupyter notebooks and play with them, let's do exactly that. I've revised a nice tutorial walkthrough that you are to now follow.
Within the tutorial is an <span style="color:yellow">Exercise</span> to be completed with your own notebook that you will commit to a private homework repository you should create and give me access to view. From prior tutorials this should be straight-forward for you now.

{: .tip }
> For your private homework submission repository use the following format to name your repo:
> `hmwk-phys709-Firstname-LastName`

Please follow the [Intro]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link notebooks/intro.ipynb %}) tutorial and complete the enclosed <span style="color:yellow">Exercise</span>.

You can simply download the `intro.ipynb` file and open it in Jupyter.

{: .warning }
Some browsers will save Jupyter notebooks with an additional `.txt` extension. If that's the case for you, simply rename it by removing the `.txt` extension. Jupyter notebook extensions are `.ipynb`.

{: .tip }
If you want a sneak-peek at the Jupyter notebook tutorial you can open it and have it rendered by [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/).
