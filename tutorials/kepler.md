# The Kepler problem

We're going to step it up a bit with this homework and put everything we're learned through the computing tasks and in-class material to the test!

Recall that in class we discussed Goldstein Problem 3.19 about the particle moving in a force field described by the Yukawa potential.
We found the equations of motion and discussed the qualitative nature of the orbits. 
For this homework, I expect you to write up the problem within the Jupyter notebook and also use your new Python and Jupyter skills to solve numerically and plot the effective potential as a function of r for a few different values of the energy and the angular momentum.
